# Causal-Impact-Analysis-Demo
This is a demo of causal impact analysis package built by Jamal Senouci (https://github.com/jamalsenouci/causalimpact/blob/master/GettingStarted.ipynb)

What is Causal Impact?
 
According to the dedicated web page, Causal Impact implements an approach to estimate the causal effect of a designed intervention on a time series. For example, how many additional daily clicks were generated by an advertising campaign? Answering a question like this can be difficult when a randomized experiment is not available.
 
How does it work?
 
Given a response time series (e.g., clicks) and a set of control time series (e.g., clicks in non-affected markets or clicks on other sites), the package constructs a Bayesian structural time-series model. This model is then used to try and predict the counterfactual, i.e., how the response metric would have evolved after the intervention if the intervention had never occurred.
